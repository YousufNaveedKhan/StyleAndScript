### What is a Website, Domain Name, and URL?

- **Website**: A website is a collection of pages that are linked together under a common name and accessible via the internet. A website can include text, images, videos, and interactive elements like forms and buttons.
  
- **Domain Name**: A domain name is the address used to identify a website on the internet. For example, `google.com` is a domain name. It’s like the home address of a website, making it easy to find online, instead of using a string of numbers (IP address).

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: A URL is the full web address used to access a specific page on a website. For example, `https://www.example.com/about` is a URL where:
  - `https://` is the protocol (secure HTTP).
  - `www.example.com` is the domain name.
  - `/about` is the specific page within the website.

### How Websites Are Hosted and Accessed

- **Web Hosting**: To make a website available on the internet, it needs to be stored on a web server. Web hosting services provide space on these servers and ensure that the website is always available for users to access. It’s like renting a space for your website to live on the internet.

- **Accessing Websites**: When users want to view a website, they enter the URL into their browser. The browser sends a request to the server hosting the website, retrieves the data, and displays the web pages on the user's device. This process uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol to ensure secure communication between the browser and the server.

### Understanding the Role of Web Design in the Development Process

- **Web Design**: Web design involves planning and creating the visual and interactive elements of a website. It includes layout, color scheme, typography, images, and buttons that users see and interact with. The goal of web design is to make websites visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **Importance**: Good web design enhances the user experience, making it easy for visitors to navigate, find information, and interact with the site. A well-designed website can increase engagement, encourage repeat visits, and help achieve the website's goals—whether it's for business, education, entertainment, or other purposes.
