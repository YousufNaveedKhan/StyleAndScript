# Lecture01: Introduction to HTML

Welcome to **Lecture 01** of our web design course. In this lecture, we will dive into the fundamental structure of an HTML document and explore various tags and elements used in HTML.

## HTML Document Structure

An HTML document is structured in a specific way to ensure proper rendering in web browsers.

### Key Concepts

1. **HTML Document Structure**

   - **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It ensures that the document is interpreted as HTML5.
   
   - **`<html>`**: The root element of the HTML document. It contains all other elements.

   - **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the document title.
   
   - **`<body>`**: Contains the content of the HTML document, including text, images, and other media.

2. **Elements**

   An **element** is a fundamental building block of an HTML document. It consists of:

   - **Start Tag (Opening Tag)**: The tag that marks the beginning of the element. For example, `<p>` is the start tag for a paragraph.
   
   - **Content (Value)**: The information or data contained within the element. For example, the text inside `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` is the content.
   
   - **End Tag (Closing Tag)**: The tag that marks the end of the element. For example, `</p>` is the end tag for a paragraph.

   Together, the start tag, content, and end tag form an element. For instance, `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` is a complete element.

   Here is a diagram illustrating the structure of an HTML element:

3. **Headings**

   Headings are used to define headings of different levels. They range from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important):
   
   - `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.

4. **Paragraphs**

   - **`<p>`**: Defines a paragraph of text. It is used to structure blocks of text.

5. **Text Formatting**

   - **`<b>`**: Makes text bold. It does not convey any semantic meaning but visually emphasizes the text.
   
   - **`<u>`**: Underlines the text.
   
   - **`<i>`**: Italicizes the text. Like `<b>`, it does not convey semantic meaning but visually changes the text style.

### Visual Aids

### Additional Notes

- **Opening and Closing Tags**: Most HTML elements come with opening and closing tags. For example, `<p>` is an opening tag, and `</p>` is the closing tag. The content is placed between these tags.
  
- **Self-Closing Tags**: Some HTML tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag, such as `<img>` for images and `<br>` for line breaks.

### Summary

In this lecture, we covered the fundamental structure of an HTML document, including document types, root and content elements, heading levels, and basic text formatting. We also introduced the concept of elements, which are crucial for creating well-structured web pages. Understanding these basics is essential for effective web design.
